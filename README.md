# antena

This repository hosts the **Antena** front-end built with Angular and TypeScript.

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js 16 or later and the Angular CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
2. Install dependencies and start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to view the app.

The front end communicates with the back end via standard HTTP APIs.
